As a break of dawn came closer
AII my hopes seemed so forlorn.
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all.
My despair was caught in motion

A face just barely true -
Shadows in blue.

A flash in the night...
In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name.
The scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain.
A twig snapped in the clearing

A glimpse of golden skin

My face within

My despair was caught in motion.
A face just barely true -
Shadows in blue.

A flash in the night...


I follow by your shadow
Caught up in the rain
A broken generation
Still live a dream in vain
There comes a sacred feeling
When they dim the light
We hope their heartache ...
When we walk down tonight
We are different
We are different
We are different
We are different all
Times of human weakness
The hour of dispair
It's time we share the secrets
Goodbye solitaire
There comes a sacred feeling
When they dim the light
We hope their heartache ...
When we walk down tonight
We are different
We are different
We are different
We are different all
