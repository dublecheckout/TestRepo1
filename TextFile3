won't have any luck with me. Forever my business

Are you saying I'm a demon? So it is!
You won't have any luck with me.
Forever my business is evil and revenge
It can't be otherwise for a demon!

What did I do to deserve the fate of an unfortunate outcast?
Constantly pestering myself with the question Who am I?
Thinking that I was a demon often helped me survive.
People everywhere called me that.

You ominous moon
In love with my torments
Taking away the souls of peace,
What are you doing to me?
Can you give me an answer
Why all the white light
He got mad at me,
What was I born for?

I remember how a crowd of peasants wanted to kill me
After that, the Inquisitors mutilated my body
Everything rebelled against the young necromancer
By making me a martyr to my talent

You ominous moon
In love with my torments
Taking away the souls of peace,
What are you doing to me?
Can you give me an answer
Why all the white light
He got mad at me,
What was I born for?

Half human,
I'm half dead.
I will remain like this forever -
I am like a wolf among sheep.
My life is full of suffering,
But the choice made by fate
No, I can't change it:
A war with myself!

Can you give me an answer,
Why all the white light
Are you mad at me?

People are my enemies, but once there were brothers.
I've put my curse on the whole neighborhood.
Crops are dying, and there is plague and famine all around
And the stray winds bring terrible cold
