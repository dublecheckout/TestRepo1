There was a microbe in one drop of water. The microbe's name was Petka. Petka had a dad and a mom. Also, of course, germs. And Petka also had grandfathers and great-grandfathers, grandmothers, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, second cousins, sisters... a whole bunch of relatives. And everyone is also a microbe.
They lived in a drop of water and therefore always walked wet. In general, microbes are very small. To them, any bug seems bigger than an elephant. And Petka was small at all, because he hadn't grown up yet.
And then one day an ant ran past a drop in which microbes lived.
Petka is a microbe
He saw the drop and said:
– It's a little hot today. Shall I drink this drop? She looks so cool.
The microbes heard and were terribly scared. They ran drop by drop, cried, screamed. In general, they started a panic.
Only Petka didn't get scared. He stuck his head out of the drop and said very loudly to the ant:
– Hey, ant, didn't your mother tell you that you can't drink raw water?!
The ant, of course, did not see Petka, but he heard his voice, was surprised and asked:
– Who is talking to me?.
"It's me, Petka the microbe,– Petka said. – I strongly advise you not to drink our drop, ant. You can get sick, because we microbes live in a drop!
– Thanks for the warning! – said the ant. – You are a true friend.
And he ran on his way. And the microbes all praised little Petka and were glad that he had saved his native drop from death.

How Petka was studied
Petka is a microbe
One day, scientists came, took a drop with microbes and carried it to their laboratory. Scientists were walking along the road, carrying a drop and talking.
– Let's talk logically, – said the most important scientist. – We're scientists, right?
– That's it! – said the most junior researcher.
– We carry a drop, and there are germs in the drop, right?
– That's it.
– So we will study these microbes.
– This is a very good idea, – said the youngest researcher.
And all the other scientists also said:
– We completely agree with you.
Petka is a microbe
The scientists brought the drop to the laboratory and put it under a microscope. And a microscope is like binoculars. If you look at it from one side, everything increases, and if you look at it from the other side, it decreases. And when scientists gathered on one side of the microscope and microbes on the other, the microbes increased, and the scientists decreased, and everyone became the same. Not really the same, but only when viewed through a microscope.
Scientists look at microbes through a microscope and say, "What interesting microbes. Some are big, and others are small."
And microbes also look at scientists through a microscope and say, "What interesting scientists."
Petka the microbe wanted, of course, to take a closer look at the scientists, he began to push everyone aside and make his way forward. And scientists say:
– Look at what kind of microbe: the smallest, but pushing.
Here an elderly microbe, Petka's great-grandfather, came up to the microscope and told the scientists:
– You don't see that we are microbes. Microbes are also different. There are harmful ones, but there are, on the contrary, useful ones. We are just useful.
And the most important scientist answers him:
– Don't worry, we know that you are useful. We took your drop on purpose so that we could show it to our youngest researcher. So that he knows too. We'll show you to him, and then we'll take you back where we got you.
"Then it's all right," says Petka's great–grandfather. – We don't mind.
Petka is a microbe
And Petka looked at the youngest researcher and suddenly stuck out his tongue at him. And the junior researcher was confused and also showed his tongue to Petka. He forgot that he was a scientist, and only remembered that he was a junior, so he did so.
Here all the microbes began to shame Petka, and all the scientists – the youngest researcher.
–Ugh, how ugly it is to show your tongue," said the microbes.
And the scientists said:
– It's very wrong to show your tongue.
– We will punish our Petka, – the microbes told the scientists, – we will not give him sweet compote after lunch.
– And we will punish our junior researcher, – the scientists said, – we will deprive him of the prize.
Petka is a microbe
– And we, – said the microbes, – will not let ours walk.
– And we, – said the scientists, – will only give our vacation in winter, when it's cold and you can't swim in the rivers.
– And we, – said the microbes, – will take away all our toys.
– And we, – said the scientists, – will tear up our dissertation, which he wrote.
Petka is a microbe
Here the junior researcher began to cry, and Petka, although he did not cry, was also very offended.
And everyone felt sorry for them. And the scientists began to stand up for Petka, and the microbes for the junior researcher.
"You'll have to forgive your own," the microbes told the scientists.
— Okay. We will forgive our own, only you will forgive yours.
And then the scientists said goodbye to the microbes and took the drop back to its place. And yet, at the very last second, Petka picked up and once again showed the junior researcher his tongue. And he also showed his tongue to Petka. It's a good thing no one noticed it.

How Petka made kefir
Petka is a microbe
One of Petka's older brothers was already so old that he even went to work. My brother worked at the dairy – he, along with other microbes, sat in a large boiler and made curdled milk from milk.
And they gave him a salary in milk. For the harmfulness. Not for its harmfulness – it was not harmful at all – but for the fact that it was harmful for him to sit in milk every day. Milk is not transparent, and it is boring to sit in it.
Petka is a microbe
Petka has been telling his brother for a long time:
– Take me with you, I also want to make curdled milk.
And his brother answered him:
– You're still a little boy, you can't do it.
And Petka thought: "Yes, it will work out. Better than yours."
And one day my brother brought his salary – a whole can of milk – and put it on the sidelines. And Petka got into the salary and began to make yogurt out of it.
Only he turned out not yogurt, but kefir. Petka is sitting in the salary and thinks: "Kefir is also nothing. Even tastier than curdled milk."
And at this time, my brother wanted to drink his salary.
He tried it and said:
– What is this?! Not a salary, but some kind of kefir!
The microbes heard and asked:
– What happened?
– Yes, – says my brother, – they gave me kefir instead of a salary.
– This is an outrage, – the microbes say, – don't leave this case like that!
Then my brother grabbed a can of kefir and Petka and ran to the director of the dairy to be indignant. And the director was just on his lunch break. The director had lunch: he ate soup, ate a cutlet and thinks: "It would be nice to drink a cold kefir now." Only he thought so – Petka's brother runs in and says:
– Here, take a look – kefir!
– Very well, – says the director, – give it here.
He took a can and began to drink kefir.
And Petka is sitting in a can and thinking: "What is going to happen now?!".
Petka is a microbe
Petka's brother watched, watched the director drink kefir, and said:
– What is it being done?! You've already drunk almost all of my salary!
– What salary? – The director was surprised. - They give you a salary in milk. For the harmfulness. And here's kefir.
– That's the point, - says Petka's brother, – they gave me kefir instead of milk. I'm not going to leave this case like this!
The director drank some more kefir, and then thought about it and said:
– And kefir is very good, delicious. You know what, let's change. I'll give you my milk salary, there it is on the bedside table in a jar, and you give me your kefir.
– Okay, – says Petka's brother, – I agree to change, only if this kefir is so delicious, so give me a little taste.
Petka is a microbe
Petka's brother and the director took turns trying kefir and drank it all. And Petka is sitting at the bottom of the can.
Petka's brother was surprised and shouted:
– What are you doing here? Get out of your paycheck right now! She's a director now.
– Okay, – says the director, – what's the matter now. Anyway, you and I drank my entire salary. That's not what we need to think and talk about now. Now I would like to know who made such a delicious kefir.
And Petka says modestly:
– I did it.
– If so, – the director rejoiced, – I will immediately hire you as the head of the kefir shop.
Petka wanted to quickly agree, but then his brother intervened: it was too early for him to work as a boss, he was still small.
The director looked at Petka and saw that he was really small.
– Nothing, – says the director, – we'll wait. And when he grows up, I will certainly take him as the head of the kefir shop. I love kefir very much.
Then Petka's brother and Petka took a jar of milk from the bedside table, said goodbye to the director and went home. And at home, my brother himself allowed Petka to get into his new salary, and for dinner the microbes tried kefir with the whole family.

How Petka was looking for a particle
Petka is a microbe
One day a telegram was brought to the drop:
Petka is a microbe
"Petka is the smallest," Petka's mother said, "let him go."
Petka went to the laboratory, and there they had been waiting for him for a long time.
"You see, Petka," said the most important scientist, "we have a problem. The particle escaped.
– What kind of particle? Petka the microbe asked.
– Elementary, small. It's so small that there's no way to catch it. And you're small yourself – it's easier for you to notice her.
– I studied her, – the junior researcher sobbed, – and she ran away...
– Our youngest overlooked, – one bearded scientist sighed and stroked the junior researcher on the head.
– Okay, don't cry – tears won't help your grief.
–That's right," said the most important scientist, –tears won't help. Now there is only one hope: for Petka.
"I'll help,– Petka the microbe promised. Tell me what to do.
– We need to look for it, – sighed the most important scientist, – she probably hid in an old nuclear reactor. We have not turned on this reactor for a long time, now all sorts of wild particles are found there.
Petka is a microbe
"Or maybe she didn't run away at all," the youngest researcher said with tears in his voice, "maybe she got lost there, and now some wild particle will swallow her…
And the junior researcher began to cry.
– Well, well! – said the bearded scientist. – Why assume the worst?
– And what does it look like, your particle? Petka asked.
– Here it is, – the most important scientist showed Petka a photo of the particle, – only it is magnified a million times here.
"I'm going to look for it," Petka said and climbed into the old nuclear reactor.
